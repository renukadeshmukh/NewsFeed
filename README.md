News Feed

Develop an application for the following problem statement. These are the minimum requirements.
• The  application would be of a leading newspaper (something like New York Times)
• An editor can login into the application. (A proper database register, login using database should be applied. The database is resource constrained.)
• An editor can update article headline in his space.
• A news update needs to reflect in newspaper feed, internet article feed and twitter feed of the application. (They may be in tabs or links and should have different database entries for themselves)
• User should able to register (at least 5 mandatory fields like first name, last name, address etc). Only authenticated user should have access to the application. Make sure the database connection is shared.
You can develop either web application or get user input in command prompt.
Implement the appropriate design patterns.
